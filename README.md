# CueLABS™ Engineering Standards

The canonical repository standard for CueLABS™ projects, packaged as a skill for
coding agents.

## What this is

This repository defines how CueLABS™ repositories are structured and provides the
reusable files to achieve it:

- **[`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md)** — the standard and the procedures (bootstrap a new
  repo; standardize an existing one), for a coding agent to follow.
- **[`templates/`](templates/)** — reusable file templates: community-health
  files, a `dependabot.example.yml`, issue/PR templates, Docker
  (`Dockerfile.{go,web,python}`, `docker-compose.example.yml`,
  `dockerignore.*`), `env.example`, and `helm/` + `terraform/` deploy
  skeletons. Dotfile templates are stored without the leading dot (copy
  `gitignore` → `.gitignore`, `dockerignore.root` → `.dockerignore`,
  `editorconfig` → `.editorconfig`).

The reference implementation of the standard is **cuesoftinc/apparule**.

## Usage

Point a coding agent at [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) and ask it to bootstrap a new
repository or standardize an existing one. The skill defines the directory
structure, naming rules (`api/common` for the Go backend; other services named
by function, never by language), required root files, the deploy convention (one
Helm chart deploys all services including Envoy), recommended versions, and the
cleanup rules.
