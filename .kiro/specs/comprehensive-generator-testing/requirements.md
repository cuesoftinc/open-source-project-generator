# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on creating a comprehensive testing suite for the open source template generator to ensure all components work correctly. The testing suite will validate that the generator can successfully create projects with all supported components (frontend, backend, mobile, infrastructure) and that each generated component functions properly with correct dependencies, builds successfully, and follows best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the template generator, I want comprehensive integration tests that validate the generator works correctly, so that I can trust the generated projects will be functional and production-ready.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the generator is executed with different component combinations THEN it SHALL create valid project structures without errors
2. WHEN a project is generated with frontend components THEN the system SHALL verify all Next.js applications build successfully
3. WHEN a project is generated with backend components THEN the system SHALL verify the Go API server compiles and runs
4. WHEN a project is generated with mobile components THEN the system SHALL verify Android and iOS projects have valid configurations
5. WHEN a project is generated with infrastructure components THEN the system SHALL verify Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform configurations are valid

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the template generator, I want automated tests that validate each component type independently, so that I can quickly identify which specific components have issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing frontend components THEN the system SHALL validate each Next.js app (main, admin, home) builds and has correct dependencies
2. WHEN testing backend components THEN the system SHALL validate the Go API compiles, tests pass, and has proper structure
3. WHEN testing mobile components THEN the system SHALL validate Android Kotlin and iOS Swift projects have correct configurations
4. WHEN testing infrastructure components THEN the system SHALL validate Docker images build, Kubernetes manifests are valid, and Terraform plans succeed
5. WHEN any component test fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the specific failure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer using the generator, I want end-to-end tests that validate complete project workflows, so that I can be confident the generated projects work as integrated systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a full-stack project THEN the system SHALL verify frontend can connect to backend APIs
2. WHEN generating projects with infrastructure THEN the system SHALL verify Docker compose configurations work correctly
3. WHEN generating projects with CI/CD THEN the system SHALL verify GitHub Actions workflows are syntactically correct
4. WHEN generating projects with security configurations THEN the system SHALL verify security settings are properly applied
5. WHEN testing complete workflows THEN the system SHALL validate all generated documentation is accurate and complete

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer running the test suite, I want performance and reliability tests, so that I can ensure the generator performs well under various conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running performance tests THEN the system SHALL complete project generation within acceptable time limits
2. WHEN testing with different configurations THEN the system SHALL handle all valid component combinations without memory issues
3. WHEN running tests repeatedly THEN the system SHALL produce consistent results across multiple executions
4. WHEN testing with edge cases THEN the system SHALL handle invalid inputs gracefully with appropriate error messages
5. WHEN running concurrent tests THEN the system SHALL maintain thread safety and avoid race conditions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer integrating the generator into CI/CD pipelines, I want automated validation tests that can run in different environments, so that I can ensure the generator works consistently across development, testing, and production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests in CI environments THEN the system SHALL execute without requiring interactive input
2. WHEN testing in different operating systems THEN the system SHALL work correctly on Linux, macOS, and Windows
3. WHEN running in containerized environments THEN the system SHALL generate projects successfully within Docker containers
4. WHEN testing with different Go versions THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with supported Go versions
5. WHEN running automated tests THEN the system SHALL provide detailed test reports and coverage metrics
