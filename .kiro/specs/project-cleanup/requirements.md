# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Open Source Template Generator has accumulated extensive testing infrastructure, performance monitoring, validation systems, and auxiliary features that exceed the core functionality requirements. This cleanup will remove irrelevant code, functions, methods, and tests to focus the project on its primary purpose: generating production-ready project templates.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Remove Excessive Testing Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining this project, I want to remove unnecessary testing complexity, so that the codebase focuses on core template generation functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing test files THEN the system SHALL retain only essential unit tests for core functionality
2. WHEN examining performance tests THEN the system SHALL remove benchmarking, concurrent generation tests, and memory optimization tests
3. WHEN checking comprehensive test suites THEN the system SHALL remove component-specific integration tests that don't validate core generation logic
4. WHEN evaluating test helpers THEN the system SHALL remove performance monitors, test reporters, and complex test orchestration utilities
5. WHEN assessing validation tests THEN the system SHALL keep basic project structure validation but remove extensive build validation and CI/CD testing

### Requirement 2: Eliminate Performance Optimization Code

**User Story:** As a developer working on template generation, I want to remove performance optimization code, so that the project maintains simplicity and focuses on correctness over optimization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing validation components THEN the system SHALL remove performance benchmarking, memory optimization, and concurrent processing features
2. WHEN examining template processing THEN the system SHALL remove template caching, parallel processing, and performance monitoring
3. WHEN checking version management THEN the system SHALL remove caching mechanisms, performance metrics, and optimization utilities
4. WHEN evaluating file operations THEN the system SHALL remove optimized I/O operations and memory management features
5. WHEN assessing interfaces THEN the system SHALL remove performance-related method signatures and optimization contracts

### Requirement 3: Simplify Version Management System

**User Story:** As a developer using the template generator, I want a simplified version management system, so that the tool focuses on basic version fetching without complex registry management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing version clients THEN the system SHALL keep basic npm, Go, and GitHub version fetching but remove advanced registry features
2. WHEN examining version storage THEN the system SHALL remove complex caching, backup/restore, and concurrent access features
3. WHEN checking security validation THEN the system SHALL remove vulnerability scanning and security issue filtering
4. WHEN evaluating version compatibility THEN the system SHALL keep basic semver parsing but remove complex compatibility checking
5. WHEN assessing version history THEN the system SHALL remove version history tracking and storage mechanisms

### Requirement 4: Remove Auxiliary Validation Systems

**User Story:** As a developer generating templates, I want basic validation only, so that the system doesn't include extensive project validation beyond template correctness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing validation engines THEN the system SHALL keep basic template syntax validation but remove project build validation
2. WHEN examining security validators THEN the system SHALL remove security pattern detection and vulnerability assessment
3. WHEN checking project type validation THEN the system SHALL remove complex project type detection and validation rules
4. WHEN evaluating setup validation THEN the system SHALL remove environment setup validation and dependency checking
5. WHEN assessing template validation THEN the system SHALL keep basic template compilation checks but remove comprehensive template analysis

### Requirement 5: Streamline CLI and Core Components

**User Story:** As a user of the template generator, I want a simple CLI interface, so that I can generate templates without complex configuration and analysis features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the CLI THEN the system SHALL provide basic generate, help, and version commands only
2. WHEN reviewing CLI features THEN the system SHALL remove template analysis, integration testing, and advanced configuration options
3. WHEN examining core app components THEN the system SHALL keep basic application logic but remove resource management and complex error handling
4. WHEN checking filesystem operations THEN the system SHALL keep basic file generation but remove optimized I/O and project validation
5. WHEN evaluating configuration management THEN the system SHALL keep simple config loading but remove advanced validation and management features

### Requirement 6: Maintain Core Template Generation

**User Story:** As a developer generating projects, I want reliable core template functionality, so that the essential template processing and file generation capabilities remain intact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating templates THEN the system SHALL maintain template engine functionality for processing Go templates
2. WHEN creating projects THEN the system SHALL preserve basic file and directory creation capabilities
3. WHEN processing configurations THEN the system SHALL keep essential project configuration parsing and validation
4. WHEN handling template functions THEN the system SHALL maintain custom template functions for project generation
5. WHEN managing templates THEN the system SHALL preserve template scanning, metadata handling, and basic processing workflows
