# Documentation Issues and Inconsistencies

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. Architecture Mismatch

**Documentation Claims:**

- Complex tool-orchestration architecture with multiple layers
- Sophisticated interface-based design with dependency injection
- Multiple executor types (NextJSExecutor, GoExecutor, AndroidExecutor, iOSExecutor)
- Fallback generator registry system

**Actual Implementation:**

- Simpler BaseExecutor pattern in `internal/generator/bootstrap/executor.go`
- Component-specific files (nextjs.go, golang.go, android.go, ios.go) but simpler than documented
- No complex interface hierarchy as described in API_REFERENCE.md
- No fallback registry as described in ARCHITECTURE.md

### 2. Missing Interfaces

**Documented but Not Found:**

- `ProjectCoordinatorInterface` (docs/API_REFERENCE.md)
- `BootstrapExecutorInterface` (docs/API_REFERENCE.md)
- `StructureMapperInterface` (docs/API_REFERENCE.md)
- Complex executor interfaces with `SupportsComponent()` and `GetDefaultFlags()` methods

**What Actually Exists:**

- `BaseExecutor` struct with `Execute()` method
- Simple component-specific implementations
- No formal interface definitions in `pkg/interfaces/`

### 3. Inconsistent Command Documentation

**CLI_COMMANDS.md Issues:**

- Documents `--interactive` flag but main.go shows it's not implemented
- Shows complex exit codes (0-5) but implementation doesn't use all of them
- Documents `cache-tools` with features that may not be fully implemented

### 4. Configuration Guide Discrepancies

**CONFIGURATION.md Issues:**

- Shows component configs with fields that may not be validated
- Documents `cors_enabled` and `auth_enabled` for go-backend but unclear if implemented
- Android/iOS config options may not match actual fallback generators

### 5. Examples Documentation

**EXAMPLES.md Issues:**

- Shows 800+ lines of examples but many may not work as documented
- CI/CD integration examples reference features that may not exist
- Environment-specific configurations may not be supported

### 6. Getting Started Guide

**GETTING_STARTED.md Issues:**

- Describes tool requirements but doesn't match actual tool discovery implementation
- Offline mode documentation may not reflect actual capabilities
- Troubleshooting steps reference features that don't exist

### 7. Architecture Documentation

**ARCHITECTURE.md Issues:**

- Describes 10 core components but actual implementation is simpler
- Shows complex data flow diagrams that don't match code
- Extension points documentation doesn't match actual extensibility
- Security architecture described is more complex than implementation

### 8. API Reference

**API_REFERENCE.md Issues:**

- Documents interfaces that don't exist
- Shows usage examples that won't compile
- Error handling patterns reference non-existent error types
- Logger interface doesn't match actual logger implementation

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Audit actual implementation** - Review all code in:
   - `cmd/generator/main.go`
   - `internal/orchestrator/`
   - `internal/generator/`
   - `pkg/`

2. **Simplify documentation** - Rewrite docs to match actual implementation:
   - Remove references to non-existent interfaces
   - Simplify architecture diagrams
   - Update API examples to use actual code
   - Remove unimplemented features

3. **Test all examples** - Verify every example in docs actually works:
   - Configuration examples
   - CLI command examples
   - Code usage examples

4. **Align terminology** - Use consistent terms throughout:
   - "Bootstrap tool" vs "external tool"
   - "Component" vs "module"
   - "Executor" vs "generator"

### Documentation Rewrite Priority

1. **HIGH PRIORITY:**
   - GETTING_STARTED.md - Most user-facing
   - CLI_COMMANDS.md - Direct user reference
   - CONFIGURATION.md - Critical for usage

2. **MEDIUM PRIORITY:**
   - EXAMPLES.md - Helpful but can be simplified
   - TROUBLESHOOTING.md - Important but can reference simpler architecture

3. **LOW PRIORITY:**
   - ARCHITECTURE.md - Can be simplified significantly
   - API_REFERENCE.md - Only needed if exposing as library
   - ADDING_TOOLS.md - Only for contributors

### Specific Fixes Needed

#### GETTING_STARTED.md

- Remove references to complex tool orchestration
- Simplify tool requirements section
- Update offline mode documentation
- Fix troubleshooting steps

#### CLI_COMMANDS.md

- Remove `--interactive` flag documentation (not implemented)
- Simplify exit code documentation
- Verify all flags actually work
- Update cache-tools documentation

#### CONFIGURATION.md

- Verify all component config options
- Remove unsupported options
- Add validation rules that actually exist
- Simplify examples

#### ARCHITECTURE.md

- Rewrite to match actual implementation
- Remove complex layer diagrams
- Simplify component descriptions
- Focus on what actually exists

#### API_REFERENCE.md

- Remove non-existent interfaces
- Update to actual struct definitions
- Fix code examples to compile
- Match actual error handling

#### EXAMPLES.md

- Test every configuration example
- Remove CI/CD examples if not supported
- Simplify to working examples only
- Add notes about limitations

#### TROUBLESHOOTING.md

- Update based on actual error messages
- Remove references to non-existent features
- Simplify debugging steps
- Focus on real issues users face

## Testing Checklist

Before considering documentation complete:

- [ ] Every CLI command example runs successfully
- [ ] Every configuration example generates a project
- [ ] All code examples compile
- [ ] Architecture diagrams match code structure
- [ ] API examples use actual interfaces/types
- [ ] Troubleshooting steps solve real problems
- [ ] No references to unimplemented features
- [ ] Terminology is consistent throughout

## Notes

This documentation appears to have been written for an idealized architecture rather than the actual implementation. A complete rewrite focusing on what actually exists would be more valuable than trying to patch individual issues.

Consider:

1. Starting with working code
2. Documenting what it does
3. Adding examples that actually work
4. Keeping it simple and accurate

The current docs are well-written but describe a different project than what's implemented.
